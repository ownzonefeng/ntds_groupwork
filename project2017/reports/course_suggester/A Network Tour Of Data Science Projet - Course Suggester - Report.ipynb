    "Once the master level is reached, students have the opportunity to choose between a vast pool of courses, as well as courses which are not part of their original study plan. However, aside from going through all the coursebooks or asking other people's opinions, there is nothing to help students select courses which may be relevant to their domains of interest. That is why the goal of this project was to work on a course suggester where the student could input the name of a course of interest or a list of courses taken and obtain a list of courses which are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so a graph where the nodes are the courses and the links are given by features was created by recovering the necessary information from the different EPFL databases. The idea was to make use of the list of courses that students took as well as the course descriptions to weight the edges. From the latter multiple attributes were recovered: the professor, keywords, pre-requisites, teaching methods, assessments, the faculty to which the course is attached and so on. All of this information was public either via is-academia or the public access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The courses each student took between 2007 and 2016, their affiliation (MT, EL, IN...), the current semester (BA1, BA2,...) as well as an XML with the course descriptions of the courses given in 2016 were provided by Francisco Pinto who already distributed this dataset during the DataJam days and can be found on the [dropbox link here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/NTDS_data). Therefore it was not necessary to do any web-scraping but there was a large portion of data cleaning and formatting before being able to construct the different graphs. It is important to note that the data is anonymous so there is no way to trace back any information to a particular student. \n",

    "- **PersonId**: unique identifier for each student\n",
    "- **Year** : the year the course was taken by the student, this was important to define the number of years in which a course was given to have a normalizing factor which accounts for courses which may be newer.\n",

    "To avoid high weights due to courses which were taken multiple times by the same students, only the record of their first enrollement was kept. \n",

    "### 2.1.5 Removing Irrelevant Courses\n",
    "All students following internships or in the CMS or first year were removed as these were irrelevant to the application.

The social science courses were also dropped as they are not linked to other courses in the study plans. \n",

    "The analysis of this table is similar to the one presented before: the courses recommended are electrical engineering courses which is a good point but it is not possible to determine precisely which method is best. One important point to be made is the fact that there is a risk of of overfitting the recommendations to the sections and their study plans. Doing so would lead to recommending courses which are not \"original\" as results."

    "Given that there was no way of doing supervised learning on the graph, the results could not objectively be assessed based on a ground truth or an objective metric. Personal knowledge of the courses within the STI faculty, more precisely within the Micro-engineering and Electrical engineering curriculums was used to judge the quality of the results which were generally satisfying. There are nonetheless improvements which can be made to graphs which were constructed : \n",

    "- For the professors' graph, as the matrix is quite sparse, another metric would need to be found to link the professors together such as the laboratories, the research domains etc... \n",
    "- For the assistants' graph an exhaustive list of assistants per course, including student assistants and teaching assistants would be required. \n",
    "- For the topics' graph, it would be interesting to find a better way to link the courses based on their content as this information is provided in the course descriptions and has much to offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the recommendation system would have benefitted largely from the knowledge of the student's preferences. Ideally one would have had the rankings of the courses or the course evaluations to know which courses students liked to recommend them to others and avoid the bias caused by the mandatory courses in the curriculum. This unfortunately was not possible as there was no way to access the course evaluations, not forgetting the fact that the evaluations are anonymous and therefore cannot be linked to a given student, as well as the fact that students do not always participate or take them very seriously. That is why it would be interesting to take the project to another level and incorporate a form of reinforcement learning so that the recommender system may take in feedback from the users and use it to improve the outputs.
